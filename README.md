# Soccer Penalty Kick Game - AP CSP Create Task

## Program Description
An interactive soccer penalty kick simulation where players score goals by moving the ball into goal areas using mouse controls.

## Computational Thinking Requirements

### 1. List Usage
- `app.fieldcolors` list stores gradient colors for visual feedback
- List indexing with modulo for cycling through colors

### 2. Procedure with Parameter
- `isInGoal(x, y)` - Takes ball coordinates as parameters and detects goal scoring
- `getfieldcolors()` - Manages color cycling for visual effects

### 3. Algorithm Implementation
- **Sequencing**: Methodical execution of goal detection and scoring logic
- **Selection**: `if/elif` statements for goal detection and state management  
- **Iteration**: Color cycling through list elements using modulo arithmetic

## Features
- Real-time score tracking
- Visual feedback on goals scored
- Boundary constraints
- Dynamic field and goal color changes

## How to Play
- Move mouse to control the soccer ball
- Score by moving ball into either goal
